# Yodkwtf | My Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built with reactjs using modern react hooks for the functionality and react router dom to configure different pages within the site. The website also has a dark mode.
The design is a complete orginal created from scratch in Figma. I'm using airtable as a headless CMS for my projects.
