## YODKWTF || My Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website built with reactjs. The design is completely original and it's built by me from scratch. I used modern react hooks like useEffect, useState, useContext, etc... for the functionality. I also implemented react router dom to configure different pages within the site. The website also has a dark mode.
