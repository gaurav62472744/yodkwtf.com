            Hello Friend. <br />
            I'm Durgesh, a <span>{age}</span> year old web developer, currently
            trying to master full stack MERN development. I have a profound
            knowledge of HTML & CSS, Javascript, React, Nodejs, and Gatsby.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've built a lot of websites and web apps and currently, I'm working
            as a freelance web developer where I deliver highly optimized
            websites to my clients and help them scale their business digitally.
            {readMore ? (
              <>
                I also run a youtube channel called Yodkwtf Academy where I
                teach web development to beginners.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I'm not coding, I love to binge watch pop culture stuff. I
                also love to play guitar and create sketches. Although I'm not
                very good at it but the creative mind does help me a bit in
                creating awesome designs for my websites.
